class for managing event callback registration, data caching, views\n * (query processing), and event generation.  There are typically two SyncTree instances for\n * each Repo, one for the normal Firebase data, and one for the .info data.\n *\n * It has a number of responsibilities, including:\n *  - Tracking all user event callbacks (registered via addEventRegistration() and removeEventRegistration()).\n *  - Applying and caching data changes for user set(), transaction(), and update() calls\n *    (applyUserOverwrite(), applyUserMerge()).\n *  - Applying and caching data changes for server data changes (applyServerOverwrite(),\n *    applyServerMerge()).\n *  - Generating user-facing events for server and user changes (all of the apply* methods\n *    return the set of events that need to be raised as a result).\n *  - Maintaining the appropriate set of server listens to ensure we are always subscribed\n *    to the correct set of paths and queries to satisfy the current set of user event\n *    callbacks (listens are started/stopped using the provided listenProvider).\n *\n * NOTE: Although SyncTree tracks event callbacks and calculates events to raise, the actual\n * events are returned to the caller rather than raised synchronously.\n *\n * @constructor\n */\nvar SyncTree = /** @class */ (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {!ListenProvider} listenProvider_ Used by SyncTree to start / stop listening\n     *   to server data.\n     */\n    function SyncTree(listenProvider_) {\n        this.listenProvider_ = listenProvider_;\n        /**\n         * Tree of SyncPoints.
